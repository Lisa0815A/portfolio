This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase professional skills, projects, and contact information in an interactive and modern layout. The main objective was to create a clean and user-friendly platform that reflects both technical and design proficiency.
The website consists of multiple sections such as Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Each section is easily navigable through smooth scrolling and a sticky header for a seamless user experience. The Projects section integrates live data using API calls, for example, to the GitHub API, allowing real-time display of repositories, commits, and project details without manual updates.
Interactive elements such as animated popups, scroll-triggered transitions, and form validation enhance user engagement. Custom JavaScript functions handle DOM events, navigation, and dynamic content rendering, while CSS media queries ensure a fully responsive design across all screen sizes.
This portfolio not only serves as a digital resume but also demonstrates frontend development skills, API integration, and modern UI/UX principles.
